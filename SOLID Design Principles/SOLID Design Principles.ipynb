    "### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Code (Violation of SRP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial `Video` class had two primary responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Representation:** Holding video attributes like `title`, `time`, `likes`, and `views`.\n",
    "2.  **Database Interaction:** Managing database connection, creating tables, and persisting video data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** The class also handles database creation, which should be done by separate class or class only dealing with database stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this bad?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If the database connection details (like the URL) need to change, or if the persistence logic needs to be updated (e.g., switching to a different ORM), you'd have to modify the `Video` class. This change might unintentionally affect the video data representation logic.\n",
    "*   Testing becomes more complex because you can't easily test the video data representation logic in isolation from the database interaction logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Code (Adherence to SRP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second code demonstrates better adherence to the SRP by separating responsibilities into distinct classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`Video` Class:** *Solely* responsible for representing video data and calculating `get_number_of_hours_played`. It doesn't deal with database interactions.\n",
    "*   **`DatabaseConnection` Class:** Manages the database connection, engine creation, and session management.\n",
    "*   **`VideoDAO` Class:** Handles the data access operations (persistence) for the `Video` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "* Separate class for each responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this better?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Each class has a single, well-defined purpose.\n",
    "*   Changes to the database connection or persistence logic only affect the `DatabaseConnection` or `VideoDAO` classes, without impacting the `Video` class.\n",
    "*   Testing becomes easier because each class can be tested independently.\n",
    "*   Makes code more readable, easier to maintain and modify."

    "### DIP Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given code, the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** is well-applied. The principle has two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**\n",
    "2.  **Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How DIP is implemented in this example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **High-Level Module:** `Service` class is a high-level module. It defines the business logic of calculating earnings. It orchestrates the calculation but doesn't know the specific implementation details.\n",
    "*   **Low-Level Modules:** `EducationalEarningsCalculator`, `GamingEarningsCalculator`, and `EntertainmentEarningsCalculator` are low-level modules. They provide concrete implementations of earnings calculation for different video categories.\n",
    "*   **Abstraction:** `IEarningsCalculator` is the abstraction. It's an interface that defines the `calculate_earnings()` method. Both high-level (`Service`) and low-level (`*EarningsCalculator`) modules depend on this abstraction.\n",
    "*   **Dependency Inversion:**  Instead of `Service` directly depending on concrete `*EarningsCalculator` classes, it depends on the `IEarningsCalculator` interface. The concrete implementations (e.g., `EducationalEarningsCalculator`) also depend on the `IEarningsCalculator` interface. This \"inverts\" the traditional dependency structure, where high-level modules would typically depend on low-level modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of DIP (and how it's demonstrated in this code):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Decoupling:** The `Service` class is decoupled from the specific earnings calculation implementations. You can change the earnings calculation logic for one video category without affecting the `Service` class.\n",
    "2.  **Flexibility:** You can easily add new video categories and corresponding earnings calculators without modifying the `Service` class. Just create a new class that implements `IEarningsCalculator` and inject it into the `Service`.\n",
    "3.  **Testability:** You can easily test the `Service` class by injecting mock implementations of `IEarningsCalculator`. This allows you to isolate the `Service`'s logic from the complexities of the concrete earnings calculation implementations.\n",
    "4.  **Maintainability:** The code is more maintainable because it's easier to understand and modify the different parts independently."
