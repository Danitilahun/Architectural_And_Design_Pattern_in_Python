    "### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Code (Violation of SRP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial `Video` class had two primary responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Representation:** Holding video attributes like `title`, `time`, `likes`, and `views`.\n",
    "2.  **Database Interaction:** Managing database connection, creating tables, and persisting video data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** The class also handles database creation, which should be done by separate class or class only dealing with database stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this bad?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If the database connection details (like the URL) need to change, or if the persistence logic needs to be updated (e.g., switching to a different ORM), you'd have to modify the `Video` class. This change might unintentionally affect the video data representation logic.\n",
    "*   Testing becomes more complex because you can't easily test the video data representation logic in isolation from the database interaction logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Code (Adherence to SRP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second code demonstrates better adherence to the SRP by separating responsibilities into distinct classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`Video` Class:** *Solely* responsible for representing video data and calculating `get_number_of_hours_played`. It doesn't deal with database interactions.\n",
    "*   **`DatabaseConnection` Class:** Manages the database connection, engine creation, and session management.\n",
    "*   **`VideoDAO` Class:** Handles the data access operations (persistence) for the `Video` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "* Separate class for each responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this better?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Each class has a single, well-defined purpose.\n",
    "*   Changes to the database connection or persistence logic only affect the `DatabaseConnection` or `VideoDAO` classes, without impacting the `Video` class.\n",
    "*   Testing becomes easier because each class can be tested independently.\n",
    "*   Makes code more readable, easier to maintain and modify."
