    "## Problem Scenario: Cryptocurrency Investing App\n",
    "\n",
    "You're building a cryptocurrency investing app that needs to reuse a complex third-party library for buying/selling crypto.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Code Duplication:**  Multiple parts of the app might need to use the same `buyCurrency` logic. Directly calling the library from each place leads to code duplication.\n",
    "*   **Tight Coupling:** Direct interaction with the library makes the app's business logic tightly coupled to the library's implementation details. Any change in the library requires changes throughout the app.\n",
    "*   **Complexity:** The library is complex and exposes too much unnecessary functionality to the rest of the application.  The application should ideally only need a simplified interface.\n",
    "*   **Requirement Changes:** New requirements (e.g., checking user balance, sending email confirmations) would necessitate modifying the `buyCurrency` logic in every location it's used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Needed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to centralize the `buyCurrency` logic, simplify the interaction with the third-party library, and isolate the rest of the application from the library's complexity, all while allowing for future modifications without widespread code changes. This is where the Façade pattern comes in."

    "## Drawbacks of Direct Subsystem Interaction (Before Facade)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above demonstrates several issues that make it a poor design choice for larger applications, and that ultimately *force* us to consider the Facade pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Tight Coupling:** The `main` function is directly interacting with `UIService`, `DatabaseService`, `CryptoFactory`, and `BitcoinService`.  Any change in the interfaces or implementations of these components will require modifications in `main` or other code directly using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Code Duplication Risk:**  If other parts of the application needed to perform the same user retrieval and crypto purchase logic, the code would be duplicated.  This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Lack of Centralized Control:** There's no central place to add logic that is related to the crypto purchase process. Consider these scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Balance Check:** What if you need to check if the user has sufficient funds *before* initiating the crypto purchase?  You'd have to add that check in every location that uses this logic.\n",
    "    *   **Post-Transaction Actions:** What if you need to send a confirmation email or log the transaction? Again, this needs to be replicated.\n",
    "    *   **Transaction Rollback:** What if a step fails? Implementing a robust rollback mechanism becomes significantly more complex with distributed logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Exposure of Implementation Details:** The `main` function needs to know how to get a user ID, how to fetch a user from the database, how to create a crypto service (using `CryptoFactory`), and how to execute the purchase.  This exposes too much of the internal workings of the system.  Clients shouldn't need to be aware of the complex object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Difficult to Test:**  Testing becomes more challenging because `main` is tightly coupled to these external services.  It's difficult to isolate the logic for unit testing.  You'd likely need to mock multiple classes to test the `main` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Maintenance Nightmare:** Any change to the underlying services can potentially break multiple parts of the application that directly use them. This increases the risk of introducing bugs and makes maintenance more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Library Versioning:** If you need to upgrade or switch the external CryptoFactory, DatabaseService libraries, you have to change every place in your code that uses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, the absence of a Facade leads to a brittle, difficult-to-maintain, and error-prone system.**  The Facade pattern provides a solution by encapsulating the complexity and offering a simplified interface.  The next step would be to introduce a class that acts as the \"face\" of the crypto purchase process, hiding the internal details and providing a clean abstraction."
