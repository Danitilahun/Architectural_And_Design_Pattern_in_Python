    "# Strategy Pattern: Payment Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A `PaymentService` needs to handle different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal). A naive approach using `if/else` or `switch` statements to handle each payment method leads to code that is hard to maintain, violates the Open/Closed Principle, and the Single Responsibility Principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy Pattern Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strategy Pattern addresses these issues by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Encapsulating Algorithms:** Defines a family of algorithms (payment methods), puts each into a separate class.\n",
    "2.  **Interchangeability:** Makes these objects interchangeable, allowing the `PaymentService` to switch payment methods easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Strategy Interface:** Defines a common interface (`PaymentStrategy`) for all payment methods. This interface includes the methods that the `PaymentService` will use (`collectPaymentDetails`, `validatePaymentDetails`, `pay`).\n",
    "2.  **Concrete Strategies:** Implement the `PaymentStrategy` interface for each payment method (`PaymentByCreditCard`, `PaymentByPayPal`).\n",
    "3.  **Context (PaymentService):**\n",
    "    *   Maintains a reference to a `PaymentStrategy` object.\n",
    "    *   Uses the strategy to process payments.\n",
    "    *   *Does not* need to know the specific payment method being used.\n",
    "4.  **Client:**\n",
    "    *   Creates a specific strategy object.\n",
    "    *   Passes it to the `PaymentService` via a setter.\n",
    "    *   Can replace the strategy at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Open/Closed Principle:** Easy to add new payment methods without modifying existing code.\n",
    "2.  **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each payment method is responsible for its own logic.\n",
    "3.  **Code Reusability:** The payment algorithms are encapsulated and reusable.\n",
    "4.  **Flexibility:** Payment method can be chosen and switched at runtime.\n",
    "5.  **Decoupling:** `PaymentService` is decoupled from the specific payment implementations.                        |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The Strategy pattern enables interchangeable algorithms by encapsulating them in separate classes.\n",
    "*   It provides flexibility, promotes code reusability, and adheres to the Open/Closed and Single Responsibility Principles.\n",
    "*   Use the Strategy pattern when you have multiple ways to perform a task and want to select the appropriate one at runtime."
