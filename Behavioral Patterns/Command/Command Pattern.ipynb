    "\n",
    "Even after encapsulating the core light-switching logic *within* the `Light` class (i.e., moving the `switchLights()` method into the `Light` class), the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) violation *still* persists. While the logic itself is now centralized, the *invocation* of that logic (`light.switchLights()`) is still scattered across multiple classes (`Room`, `FloorLamp`, `LivingRoom`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this still a problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Tight Coupling:** `Room`, `FloorLamp`, and `LivingRoom` are *directly* dependent on the `Light` class's `switchLights()` method. If the `Light` class's API changes (e.g., the `switchLights()` method is renamed or takes arguments), *all* the classes that call it must be modified.\n",
    "2.  **Limited Flexibility:** If we want to introduce new light-switching behaviors (e.g., dimming, color changing, scheduling), we'd have to modify the `Light` class *and* potentially the classes that call `switchLights()`.\n",
    "3.  **SRP Violation:** `Room`, `FloorLamp`, and `LivingRoom` have responsibilities *beyond* just being rooms and floor lamps. They're also responsible for *how* the light is switched.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, even though the *logic* is encapsulated, the *control* is still distributed, leading to a design that is less flexible, less maintainable, and more prone to breaking changes. The Command pattern aims to solve this by completely decoupling what needs to be done from *how* it's triggered."

    "# Command Pattern: Smart Home Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a smart home automation app to control lights in a house. Initial approach involves representing each room as a class inheriting from a base `Room` class with light switching logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with Inheritance Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Fragile Base Class:** Modifying the base `Room` class's light logic risks breaking subclasses (e.g., `Bathroom`, `LivingRoom`).\n",
    "2.  **Lack of Flexibility:** Difficult to remove features (e.g., light control) from specific rooms (e.g., bathrooms with sensors) without affecting others.\n",
    "3.  **Code Duplication:** If new elements like a `FloorLamp` need the same light logic, it can't inherit from `Room`, leading to duplicated code.\n",
    "4.  **SRP Violation:** Classes other than `Light` are controlling the switching which is a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution: Command Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Encapsulate Logic:** Move light-switching logic into the `Light` class itself to ensure consistent behavior across the application.\n",
    "2.  **Extract Request Details:** Encapsulate the method call (object, method name, arguments) into a separate `Command` class.\n",
    "3.  **Invoker/Receiver:** Rooms and FloorLamps now hold a `Command` object and have an `execute_command` method. They *invoke* the command but don't *perform* the action directly. The `Light` class becomes the *receiver* of the command, actually executing the light switching.\n",
    "4. The client has more flexilibity\n",
    "## Command Pattern Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Command Interface:** Declares a single `execute` method.\n",
    "*   **Concrete Commands:** Implement the `Command` interface (e.g., `SwitchLightsCommand`).\n",
    "*   **Invoker (Sender):** Initiates the request; holds a reference to a `Command` object (e.g., `Room`).\n",
    "*   **Receiver:** Contains the business logic to perform the action (e.g., `Light`).\n",
    "*   **Client:** Creates and configures `Command` objects, passing in request parameters and a receiver instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Command Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Decoupling:** Separates classes that *invoke* operations from classes that *perform* them.\n",
    "2.  **SRP Adherence:** Each class has a single responsibility.\n",
    "3.  **Flexibility:** Easily add new commands (e.g., open/close curtains) without modifying existing classes.\n",
    "4.  **Runtime Configuration:** Decisions are made at runtime by the client, increasing flexibility.\n",
    "5.  **Queueing/Scheduling:** Commands can be serialized and scheduled, queued, logged, or sent over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Passing commands as method arguments.\n",
    "*   Storing commands in other objects.\n",
    "*   Switching linked commands at runtime.\n",
    "*   Queueing and scheduling operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "The Command pattern turns a specific method call into a standalone object, providing flexibility, decoupling, and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle. It separates what needs to be done from how it's triggered."
